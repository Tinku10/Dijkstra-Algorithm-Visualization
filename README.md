# Dijkstra-Algorithm-Visualization
This is a visualization path finding algorithm which uses Dijkstra. As such, it considers a grid with nxn nodes in it, where every node is connected to all the adjecent node( it can be varied from 4 to 8). It avoids obstacles in the path and finds the shortest path between the source and destination.
Because the nodes are connected and a visualization for edge weight is difficult, edge weight is taken as 1. But the core concept of Dijkstra's algorithm is followed.
